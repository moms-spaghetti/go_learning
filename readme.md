# Go Learning

A collection of features in the go language as I begin learning Go.\
<br/>
No demo is available for this repo. Runs directly from cmd / terminal.
<br/><br/>

## Details

I've started learning Go to broaden my knowledge alongside javascript. This repo is a collection of different functionality within Go.\
<br/>

## Built With

- Go
  <br/>

## Getting Started

Clone the repo.
<br/><br/>

## Prerequisites

The go software
Written in vscode. Everything can be run from the terminal.
<br/><br/>

## Installation

1. Install the go software from [here](https://golang.org/doc/install)
2. Check go has been installed correctly by opening a cmd / terminal window
   ```sh
   go version
   ```
   If no version shows you may need to restart your machine or add go to the PATH variable on your operating system. Information on how to do this is [here](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/setting-up-go-programming-language-on-windows-f02c8c14e2f/) see phase 3.
3. Install the official go extension in vscode Name: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=golang.Go
4. Install the additional binaries required for the extension
   ```sh
   ctrl + shift + p
   ```
   In the search box type: **install/update tools**. Tick all items and click ok
5. Check Go environment variables from the terminal. The most important is the GOPATH variable.
   ```sh
   go env
   ```
6. Navigate to the GOPATH in the terminal and make a src directory at this location
   ```sh
   cd go path here
   ```
   ```sh
   mkdir src
   ```
7. Clone the repo to the newly created src folder
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/moms-spaghetti/go_learning-.git
   ```
8. You can now navigate through each folder and run each file. In vscode ctrl + f5 will run the file selected. Alternatively, navigate to the folder containing the file in the terminal and run:
   ```sh
   go run filename.go
   ```

Exchange 'filename' for the name of the file you need to run. The returned output will appear in the terminal.
<br/><br/>

## Usage

After following the instructions above, navigate through each folder and run the contents of the file inside. You can also run the files from a cmd prompt.
